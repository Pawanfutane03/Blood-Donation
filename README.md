 **Project Title: Data scientist salary prediction using machine learning**

**Overview**  
This project utilizes **Linear Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** to solve [specific problem]. The goal is to predict [outcome, e.g., house prices, sales, etc.] using historical data. By leveraging these machine learning techniques, the model can make accurate predictions and provide valuable insights.

 **Technologies Used**  
- **Python**
- **Linear Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **NumPy** (for numerical operations)
- **Scikit-learn** (for implementing the models)
- **Matplotlib**/**Seaborn** (for data visualization)

 **Key Features**  
- **Linear Regression Model**: Used for predicting continuous outcomes based on linear relationships in the data.
- **KNN Model**: Applied for classification or regression tasks based on the closest neighbors.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes steps for cleaning and preparing data for modeling.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-Squared**.

 **Setup Instructions**  
`
  
1. Install dependencies:  
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Run the project:  
    `python model.py`

 **Usage**  
1. Load your dataset into the script and modify the file paths if necessary.  
2. The script will train and evaluate the models (Linear Regression and KNN) based on the provided data.  
3. View the model performance metrics and visualizations in the output.

 **Contributing**  
Feel free to contribute by opening issues or submitting pull requests to enhance the model or add more features.
